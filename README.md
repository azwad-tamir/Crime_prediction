## Crime Prediction and Forecasting using Machine Learning Algorithms

This research will focus on machine learning
algorithms for crime forecasting. In the modern world, crime is
becoming a major and complex problem. In this research, we
discover the best course of action for teaching a model to forecast
crime in major metropolitan cities. The purpose of this study is
to provide the Police Department with proper crime forecasting
so they can better delegate their resources in response to future
crime hotspots. We applied several machine learning models to
predict the severity of a reported crime based on whether the
crime would lead to an arrest or not. We also did a deep dive into
the city districts and studied the crime trends by year. We used
Folium to do data visualization for the study of these trends. We
discovered trends in the number of crimes and the arrest rate
from year to year. The different machine learning models that
we developed are the Random Forest, K-Nearest-Neighbours,
AdaBoost, and Neural Network. We tested our models on the
Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement
Analysis and Reporting) system, which has more than 6,000,000
records. Among all four models, the Neural Network has the best
outcome with an accuracy of 90.77%. This study also provides an
insight into the applicability of different machine learning
models in analyzing crime report datasets from large
metropolitan cities.
